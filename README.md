# 03 Password Generator
> Created an application that generates a random password

This was a homework assignment where we created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Completed
* Created the logic inside the generatePassword function
* Added comments for accessibility
